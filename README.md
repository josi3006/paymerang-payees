# Paymerang Payee Reports

## This is NOT an official product of Paymerang

## Purpose

This app generates reports for Paymerang authorized employees. A report is generated when the user searches for a particular Payee.  All identifying data and payment remittance data for that Payee are displayed in a concise report.

This allows for quick, accurate reporting of Paymerang-managed payments.

## Technology

This app is built using React, as well as HTML, CSS and Javascript.  It includes the Bootstrap library for styling and layout, as well as Google fonts.  The data used is sourced from an included JSON file.

I chose React because of the interactive nature of the app's purpose, the speed of rendering data in React, and the ability to deploy the app as a single-page app.

### Future Development

- I hope to modify the search capability to include searching of the entire JSON data blob, not just by Payee name.

- I'd like to render the dates in a more readable, pleasing format.

- In a real-world application, the data would be called from an API, rather than an included JSON file.

# BIG ASTERISK

* This application was created and deployed as an exercise, and is in no way affiliated with official Paymerang products.
